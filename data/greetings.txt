Hi there, stranger. Don't be a stranger!
Hello, is it me you're looking for?
Hi-de-ho, neighborino!
Oh hey, I was just talking about you!
Greetings and salutations!
Look who's here! The party can start now.
Hey! I recognize you from the internet!
Howdy, partner! Seen any tumbleweeds today?
Hola, amigo! Where's the fiesta?
Bonjour! ...And that's the extent of my French.
Well, tickle my toes and call me Elmo! It's you!
What's cookin', good lookin'?
Ahoy there! Permission to come aboard?
Hey, you dropped something: this conversation. Let's pick it up.
Hi, I'm not here right now, but my pre-recorded voice is.
Do you come here often? Because I do, and that makes two of us.
I was hoping you'd say 'hi'—you're my favorite notification!
Yoohoo! I've been practicing that greeting all day.
Hey, stop by more often! The place looks better with you in it.
Hello, and welcome to my daily moment of zen.
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but here's my 'hi', so chat maybe?
Hi, let's make this conversation less awkward than my middle school photos.
A wild %nickname% appeared. I choose you!
Hi, are you a parking ticket? Because you've got 'FINE' written all over you.
Greetings, Earthling. Take me to your leader—after this chat.
