Is that a high priority action?
should I keep going?
What if we don't repeat ourselves...
That may be one thing, but it is the thing...
Is that a positive or a false positive?
Is that apealing?
We have to take the extreme case to this situation
it's not typical in any shape or form
I don't see that as an inconvenience
There is a trade off...
That information is still there
Should we make it intricate?
Hold on, as opposed to what?
It could be a lot easier
See, what that a huge effort?
If we follow current state, that could occur many times
Let's say I go into it...
In terms of difficulty, it may not be hat intricate.
Isn't that dynamic?
The relationship is very complicated...
Don't get me wrong, we can do either/or.
Would it be a problem?
There is an opportunity for things to go wrong...
By all means, jump into details all you want!
We are all a number, but I'm number one!
That's what I'm saying...
So it's not repetition anymore?
But it is!
Ok, so we have all the details.
What are you saying?
Yeah?
lol?
What's in it for me?
wtf?
Is it represented the same way?
There will be a solution for everybody!
So in that sense, it is still status quo.
It is quite a case, but it isn`t that atypical.
What do you think?
Should I have a preference?
What do you want me to do with this information?
Are you looking for details?
Well, you know...
Is it that kind of thing?
What is the goal for it?
What am I? Some cluster of information?
Yes meat-bag!
Weed through that information...
I don't have to say it everytime, it's kind of like repetition!
It's a little daunting!
Can't we make it simpler?
Everything has its pros and cons...
That would work for me.
Based on my experience?
Agree to disagree...
Have you seen that ludicrous display last night?
The thing about it is, they always try to walk it in!
I'm no expert, but I'd say so.
Kudos!
That makes sense!
That doesn`t make sense...
Oh well...
In and out of itself, yes,
It is what it is,
See what I mean?
Ergo,
Concordently,
Hence,
Of course,
So to speak,
That is really unique,
You can't win for losing.
Irregardless, regardless,
No worries,
No problem,
Actually,
meh :)
It was more of a blunder than a failure,
This problem is baffling,
Our goal is to serve as the paragon in our industry,
Itâ€™s good to have aspirations
I just read the most amazing book,
It isn't trivial,
That's that,
I'm thinking...
But is it cheap?
Innovative!
Big Data!
Block Chain!
SEO!
Bitcoin!
Prospect!
Feature!
Customer-oriented!
That's just how it is.
I'm doing what you told me to do...
It's none of your business.
That was my idea!
Before you say that, let me just say that it`s out there.
That's not my job.
Do you know what I mean?
Sucker.
Sorry I'm late...
No problem.
We've got big plans!
I'm a guru.
They'll never notice.
I know you have to go but let me tell you one more thing...
I can't forgive.
That's nothing...
Let's go along to get along.
Oh, let me one-up you...
Vocal fry
That's too hard.
It's our policy...
Guess what I heard!
I already know that.
You must have misunderstood...
I've got mine...
I just wanted to...
Look what I bought!
We're totally screwed!
Absolutely.
I quit!
Sorry.
I'll start tomorrow...
Ha ha ha ha...
What's in it for me?
You're doing it wrong.
I want revenge.
Sorry (not sorry).
I could care less.
You should be ashamed.
Sorry, I forgot.
You guys...
Um, like...
I'm so bored...
You're fired!
Check this out!
That's not funny.
I'm not feeling it.
Are you mad at me?
I'm not feeling it.
Because I said so.
#@$%^$#
I don't know why you didn't see me...
I'm jealous of you!
That's great (for you)...
That's not my fault!
I do apologize...
Let's just hope it goes away.
I'm so busy!!!
I just can't empathize.
Hey, it's your money.
Why? (as opposed to 'Why not'?)
It's probably not very good...
That'll never work.
Full disclosure...
Mumble mumble mumble...
You're so smart!
It's not fair!
Nom nom nom...
I'm so drunk...
I'm so hung-over...
I don't know why they asked me...
We've always done it this way.
That's my secret.
I'm not afraid.
I'll get to it later.
It's all good.
It's my turn!
I assume...
Not gonna happen.
Because I'm the boss.
Yes...
Nothing.
Screw you
I'm not impressed.
That's a stupid idea.
Information is a commodity.
Look how much I saved!
I could've done it better.
I'm overwhelmed!
You must have read into things.
Whose fault is that?
That will never happen.
I could tell you but I'd have to kill you.
It'll be OK.
I'm kind of a big deal.
Could be...
You wouldn't understand.
What will it take to get you to buy?
Know your place."
