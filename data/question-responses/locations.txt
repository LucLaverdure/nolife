At the edge of yesterday's horizon.
Just beyond the fourth wall.
Nestled in the corner of your pocket dimension.
Tucked under a quantum couch cushion.
Inside the loop of an infinite Möbius strip.
Where the Wi-Fi connects automatically.
Halfway through a wormhole detour.
At the intersection of myth and math.
Floating in a cloud of existential doubt.
Down the rabbit hole's other exit.
In the lost baggage claim of time travel airlines.
Orbiting the satellite of love.
Resting on a paradox pedestal.
In a parallel universe's cul-de-sac.
At the summit of an imaginary mountain.
Parked on the double yellow timeline.
Waiting in the lobby of the Probability Hotel.
At the crossroads of destiny and déjà vu.
In a glitch of the Matrix.
On the outskirts of an outlandish thought.
In the echo chamber of echoes.
On the flip side of a black hole event horizon.
At the end of an infinite jest.
Right under the universal rug.
In the blind spot of the third eye.
Somewhere over the theoretical rainbow.
In the buffering zone of reality.
On the treadmill of the gods.
At the secret handshake spot of the cosmos club.
In the VIP section of the void.
Floating in the bubble of a multiverse.
In the footnotes of a fairy tale.
At the corner of surreal street and absurd avenue.
On the wavelength of a brainwave.
In the disclaimers section of a wish.
Inside the ink of an invisible map.
On the cutting room floor of a dream.
At the rendezvous point of past and future selves.
In the pause between plot twists.
At the vanishing point of Venn diagrams.
In the silent space between thoughts.
On the undiscovered island of misfit toys.
In the soft spot of a hardened skeptic.
Where the wild thoughts roam free.
At the fountain of fanciful musings.
In the lost and found of alternate realities.
On the axis of an astronomical anomaly.
In the shadows of the spotlight.
Behind the curtain of certainty.
On the other side of the looking-glass.
On the chalkboard of the universe's classroom.
Underneath the overthinking cap.
Between the lines of a secret code.
At the corner where coincidence meets fate.
In the storage unit of unused potential.
Behind the mask of the moon.
In the network of cosmic background chatter.
At the deep end of the thought pool.
Under the weather of a brainstorm.
In the nest of a cosmic stork.
Inside the bubble wrap of reality.
On the outskirts of Occam's razor.
In the groove of a vinyl universe.
At the last bus stop before oblivion.
In the static of a frequency fumble.
On the other line of a parallel call.
At the meeting point of mind and matter.
On the fringe of a figment's imagination.
Inside the echo of a shout into the void.
Where the sidewalk of sanity ends.
On the pendulum swing of possibilities.
At the heart of a brainstorm.
In the labyrinth of collective consciousness.
Where the rubber meets the road of revelation.
On the tip of Occam's razor.
In the loop of a deja vu.
In the margins of the main storyline.
Under a cloak of invisibility.
On the other end of an interdimensional hotline.
In the recycling bin of reborn ideas.
Where the ley lines of logic cross.
In the comfort zone of a quantum quandary.
At the pivot point of a paradigm shift.
Within the bounds of boundless creativity.
In the secret compartment of Schrödinger's suitcase.
On the treadmill of transcendental thoughts.
At the base of the cerebral waterfall.
In the engine room of the imagination.
On the bridge between belief and bewilderment.
Perched atop the pinnacle of a platitude.
In the drafts folder of the universe.
On the event horizon of an epiphany.
At the source of a synaptic spark.
Where the echoes of eternity whisper.
In the sandbox of the surreal.
On the diving board above the pool of possibility.
At the crosswalk of chaos and clarity.
Within the prism99. In the VIP lounge of virtual vicinities.
At the end of a Möbius strip mall.
